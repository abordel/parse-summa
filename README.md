Parse the project gutenberg summa theologiae

## About
This project started to assist my efforts to provide a web version of the summa theologiae.
It is essentially a small set of scripts that transform the project gutenberg
summa theologiae files into csv and then markdown for use with the sphinx documentation generator.

After execution I found various errors with the project gutenberg works which have yet to be submitted.

I think that the Summa Theologiae by St. Thomas Aquinas represents the height of rationality behind belief in the Incarnation and Resurrection
and I hope that it serves others.
